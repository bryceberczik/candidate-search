## Description
The Candidate Search App is a web application designed to streamline the process of finding potential candidates for job positions using the GitHub API. This app allows users to search for GitHub users based on specific criteria, review their profiles, and make decisions to either accept or reject them as potential candidates. Accepted candidates are then added to a table for further review and comparison.

## Installation
In order to use this application, as it is a deployed project, no installation is required.

## Usage
To use this application you must visit the URL and the api will begin calling once you load the page. From there you can decide whether to decline or accept a user. If you choose to accept a user you can visit the saved candidates on the navbar and see into further detail and compare the users all together.
